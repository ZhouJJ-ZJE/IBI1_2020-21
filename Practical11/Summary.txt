The alignment score of DNA sequences between human and mouse is is 1091 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 89.63963963963964
The alignment score of DNA sequences between human and random is -250 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 5.405405405405405
The alignment score of DNA sequences between mouse and random is -250 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 5.8558558558558556
 
89.6%gene of humans and mice are alomost the same, which might can prove that humans and mice have the same ancestor. 
Also, this can prove the feasibility of experiments with mice, because many of the mechanisms of the human body and mice might be similar.
